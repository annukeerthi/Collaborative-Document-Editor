Overview: 
Building a Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor
 * Frontend (React/Vue.js):
   * Rich Text Editor: Utilize a rich text editor library (e.g., Draft.js, Quill) to provide users with formatting options (bold, italics, lists, images, etc.).
   * Real-time Synchronization: Implement real-time updates to the document content using WebSockets or a similar technology. This requires careful synchronization logic to ensure all users see the same changes simultaneously and resolve conflicts effectively.
   * User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface for collaboration, including features such as user cursors, presence indicators, and chat functionality.
 * Backend (Node.js, Python/Django/Flask):
   * WebSocket Server: Set up a WebSocket server (using libraries like Socket.IO) to handle real-time communication between clients.
   * Data Storage: Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store document data, user information, and collaboration history.
   * Synchronization Logic: Implement robust algorithms to handle concurrent edits, resolve conflicts, and maintain data consistency across all users.
   * API: Create a RESTful API to handle user authentication, document creation, and other relevant operations.
